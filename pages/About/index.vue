                        <p>Before I stepped into the world of product design, I was a web developer. One of my earliest jobs involved writing HTML emails, in a time before email linters. Lots of wishing, hoping, and finger crossing that your email arrived in a recipient's inbox in one piece.
    
    Coding emails forced me to understand how HTML and CSS play together, a skill set I've carried and kept fresh in the years since. My side project work is just an excuse to satisfy my curiosity about new technologies and understand how the web is moving forward.
    
    Outside work, I enjoy good coffee near my home by the sea, listening to and playing music, exploring the world with my partner, and playing with my Labrottie pup, Louie.</p>
